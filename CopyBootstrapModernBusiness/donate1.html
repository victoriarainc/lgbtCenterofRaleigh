          <p>ReachOUT NC aims to band together and mobilize the LGBT community and its allies by providing volunteer opportunities for its members to improve the lives in our community by promoting goodwill.</p>
          <p>“There is nothing to do here besides going to the bars and clubs.” How many times have you heard that? ReachOUT is a brand new organization for the LGBT community and its allies. We are a group that comes together on a regular basis to do good things for the areas in which we live.

While the projects may vary from month to month, they will always be focused on making a positive difference in the world and having a great time doing it.</p>
          <p>We welcome ALL volunteers regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, religion, age, and ability.</p>
