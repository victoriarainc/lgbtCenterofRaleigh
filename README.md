#Project
2017 Redesign of the LGBT Center of Raleigh's website. Web Developers Victoria Coleman and Kelly Miller both designed and built a new layout to improve the Center's web application.

##Objectives
- Update layout to a more modern design
- Reach out to a new demographic of the community while continuing to care for the center's current member and volunteer base
- Increase the number of donations and sustainers

##Process

###Community Involvement
Voices from all over Raleigh helped contribute to this redesign. Staff, volunteers, and members of the center were all welcomed to provide feedback and ideas for the website. This is an application that affects a large and growing community. Their voices mattered most during the planning and development of the LGBT Center of Raleigh's website.

The Executive Director James Miller, Assistant Executive Director Kelly Taylor, and Web Developer Jim Manchester all led the way for this redesign to be a successful project that benefited both the community and the Center.

###Research
Kelly Miller led the research and analysis of non-profit web design. She uncovered related color theory, user experience methods, and performed SWOT analysis on other sites with similar objectives. Her education and background directly benefited the project and implemented a strategy that achieved our goals for the website.
